First we put them into variables

Total amountal of aliens are 10,000

Use var aliens = "10,000"

if there are more than 5,000 green aliens
write console.log "No,why?????" 

if there are more than a total of 8,000 green and
red aliens combined
write console.log w/ "Ugh, why are they so ugly?"

not more than 3000 red and blue aliens combined
write console.log "Okay, this seems somewhat manageable. 
Wait no, we're still dead..."

You may assign alien amounts yourself (Must add up to 10,000)

Use 
var name = "??"
if (name == ??) {
  console.log ("CommentHere")
}else if(){
  console.log()
}

==================================================
var green = 7000;
var red = 1000;
var blue = 2000;

var aliens = green + red + blue;

if (aliens == 10000){
  console.log("Wow so many aliens");
}
if (green > 5000){
  console.log ("No, why!");
}
if (green + red >= 8000){
  console.log("Ugh, why are they so ugly?");
}
if (red && blue < 3000) {
  console.log ("Okay, this seems somewhat manageable. Wait no, we're still dead...");
}
